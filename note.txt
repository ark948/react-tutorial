It is a rule that React components must always start with a capital letter.

in jsx files, we can use {} to escape back to js code.

if you're rendering a list of items, make sure each item has a key attribute
(just like without list of products items that we converted to li)
react uses this key to know what happens to each item

sometimes we need to remember some information about something and display it.
react offers state for this purpose. (useState hook)
