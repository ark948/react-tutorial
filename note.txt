It is a rule that React components must always start with a capital letter.

in jsx files, we can use {} to escape back to js code.

if you're rendering a list of items, make sure each item has a key attribute
(just like without list of products items that we converted to li)
react uses this key to know what happens to each item

sometimes we need to remember some information about something and display it.
react offers state for this purpose. (useState hook)

(components use state to remember things)

to collect data from multiple children, or to have two child components communicate with each other, declare the shared state in their parent component instead.
(this is called lifting state up to parent component)

when the state of a component is changed, it will trigger a re-render of that component

In React, it’s conventional to use onSomething names for props which represent events and handleSomething for the function definitions which handle those events.

React official doc has the tic-tac-toe project.
